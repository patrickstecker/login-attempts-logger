Certainly! Here are some recommendations to improve the security of the plugin and prevent SQL injections, XSS attacks, file inclusion attacks, and brute force attacks:

    Use WordPress' built-in functions for database interactions to prevent SQL injection attacks. Replace the $wpdb->insert and $wpdb->get_results calls with $wpdb->prepare statements. Here's an example:

perl

$wpdb->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE username = %s", $username);

    Use proper input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS attacks. Replace the sanitize_text_field and sanitize_user functions with more appropriate ones. For instance, use esc_html for outputting text to HTML, esc_url for outputting URLs, and wp_kses for more complex HTML tags. Here's an example:

php

$ip_address = esc_html($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
$user_agent = wp_kses($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], array());

    Use absolute paths and check the file paths before including any files to prevent file inclusion attacks. Replace the require_once( ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php' ); with the following code:

perl

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
  die( 'You are not allowed to access this file directly.' );
}
require_once( ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php' );

    Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. You can use WordPress' built-in function wp_login_failed to increment a counter and log users out after a certain number of failed attempts. You can also use a plugin like Limit Login Attempts Reloaded to enforce a rate limit on login attempts.

By following these recommendations, you can significantly improve the security of your plugin and prevent SQL injections, XSS attacks, file inclusion attacks, and brute force attacks.
